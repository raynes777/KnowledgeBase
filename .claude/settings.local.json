ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA MODIFICATION\\\\n   Original: Age 18-70 years\\\\n   Revised: Age 18-75 years\\\\n   Rationale: Recent safety data from similar CAR-T studies demonstrate acceptable safety profile in patients up to 75 years old. This expansion will improve enrollment and provide treatment access to older patients.\\\\n\\\\n2. DOSE ESCALATION MODIFICATION\\\\n   Original: Fixed dose of 1x10^6 CAR-T cells/kg\\\\n   Revised: Dose escalation cohorts:\\\\n   - Cohort 1: 5x10^5 cells/kg \\(n=6\\)\\\\n   - Cohort 2: 1x10^6 cells/kg \\(n=6\\)\\\\n   - Cohort 3: 2x10^6 cells/kg \\(n=12\\)\\\\n   Rationale: Preliminary data from ongoing CAR-T trials suggest higher doses may improve response rates without increasing severe toxicity beyond manageable levels.\\\\n\\\\n3. FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT\\\\n   Original: Monthly visits for 12 months\\\\n   Revised: Weekly visits for Month 1, bi-weekly for Months 2-3, monthly for Months 4-12\\\\n   Rationale: Increased early monitoring will enable better detection and management of acute toxicities \\(CRS, neurotoxicity\\) which typically occur within first 30 days.\\\\n\\\\n4. ADDITIONAL BIOMARKER ANALYSIS\\\\n   Added: Optional tumor microenvironment analysis via serial biopsies at Day 0, Week 4, and Week 12\\\\n   Rationale: Correlative studies to understand mechanisms of response and resistance.\\\\n\\\\nREGULATORY IMPACT:\\\\n- Ethics Committee approval required before implementation\\\\n- All currently enrolled patients will be informed of amendments\\\\n- New consent form version 2.1 to be signed\\\\n\\\\nAPPROVALS:\\\\nPrincipal Investigator: _______________  Date: _______\\\\nSponsor Representative: _______________  Date: _______\")",
